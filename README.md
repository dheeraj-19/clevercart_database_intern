### Problem Statement

You are required to create a Python program that can scrape recipe data from multiple websites and export the collected data into a CSV file. The program should be able to extract the following information from each recipe:

- Recipe Name
- Description
- Instructions(separated by “\n”)
- List of Grocery Item Names
- List of Grocery Item Quantity
- List of Grocery Item Quantity Type
- Cook Time

Your program should be able to scrape at least 10 manually imputed recipe websites, and the quality of the scraping will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:

- The accuracy of the scraped data.
- The amount of data that can be extracted from each website.
- The number of websites that can be scraped.

### Requirements

Your program should be able to perform the following tasks:

1. Accept the URLs of multiple recipe websites as input.
2. Scrape the webpages of the provided URLs and extract the required information from each recipe.
3. Export the scraped data into a CSV file.

### Constraints

1. The program should be written in Python.
2. You can use any third-party libraries or tools that are available in Python.
3. The program should be able to scrape at least three recipe websites.
4. The program should be able to extract the required information from each recipe.
5. The CSV file should be well-formatted and easy to read.
